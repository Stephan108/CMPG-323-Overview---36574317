## Branching Stratergies
I will be using the standard GitFlow Branching method. Where I would have my Master branch and directly below it my development branch.
In the developmetn branch I will have my fetures branches, in which i will add my new fetures before adding it to the development and then finally the master branch
Since it's simpler to switch between stages of the development pipeline thanks to this branching method, this might give me more flexibility.
