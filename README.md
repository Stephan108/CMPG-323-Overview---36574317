## Branching Stratergies
I will be using the standard GitFlow Branching method. Where I would have my Master branch and directly below it my development branch.
In the developmetn branch I will have my fetures branches, in which i will add my new fetures before adding it to the development and then finally the master branch
Since it's simpler to switch between stages of the development pipeline thanks to this branching method, this might give me more flexibility.

## Usage of git.ignore
A git.ignore file is a plain text file with a pattern for files and directories to ignore on each line.
    I'll be using it to secure log files and most importantly files with API keys/secrets, credentials, or sensitive information.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
I'll  be using the git.ignore function. By adding my sensitive information or credentials to a file which i will add to git.ignore it will ensure that no sensitive data will  be unintentionally merged and pushed to my repositries.
